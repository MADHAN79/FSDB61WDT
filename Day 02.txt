QN: Write a blog on the difference between a document and a window object.

INTRODUCTION:

    In the world of web development, JavaScript is an essential language that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. 
Two fundamental objects in JavaScript that play a crucial role in manipulating the web page and its contents are the window and document objects.
Understanding the differences between these two objects is vital for anyone looking to master JavaScript and web development.

======================================
I. Introduction to the Window Object |
======================================
    The window object is the global object in a browser environment. It represents an open window in a browser and provides methods and properties 
that are essential for controlling the browser window and performing various tasks. Every global variable and function defined in JavaScript 
becomes a property or method of the window object.

Key Features of the Window Object:
----------------------------------

Global Context: 
    The window object serves as the global context in the browser. Any variable or function declared in the global scope is a property 
or method of the window object. For instance, if you declare a variable var x = 10;, it can be accessed using window.x.

Browser Control: 
    The window object provides methods to control the browser window, such as window.open(), window.close(), window.resizeTo(), and 
window.moveTo().

Timers: 
    The window object offers timer functions like setTimeout(), setInterval(), clearTimeout(), and clearInterval(), which are used to execute 
code after a specified delay or at regular intervals.

User Interaction: 
    Methods like alert(), prompt(), and confirm() are part of the window object and are used to interact with the user.

Navigation: 
    Properties such as window.location, window.history, and window.navigator provide information and control over the browser's navigation 
and history.

=========================================
II. Introduction to the Document Object |
=========================================

The document object, on the other hand, represents the HTML document that is loaded into the browser window. It is a property of the window object 
and provides methods and properties for accessing and manipulating the content of the web page.

Key Features of the Document Object:
------------------------------------

Content Manipulation: 
    The document object allows you to access and manipulate the content of the web page. You can use methods like getElementById(), 
getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), and querySelector() to select elements and modify their content or attributes.

Structure Navigation: 
    The document object provides properties like document.body, document.head, and document.documentElement to navigate the structure 
of the HTML document.

Event Handling: 
    The document object supports event handling, allowing you to add event listeners to elements using methods like addEventListener().

Document Metadata: 
    Properties such as document.title, document.URL, and document.cookie provide information about the document's metadata and allow you 
to manipulate it.

III. Differences Between Window and Document Objects |
======================================================

While the window and document objects are closely related and often used together, they serve distinct purposes and have different functionalities. 
Here are the key differences between them:

1. Scope and Representation:

i)  Window: The window object represents the browser window itself. It encompasses everything related to the window, including its size, position and 
global context.
ii) Document: The document object represents the content of the web page loaded in the browser window. It provides access to the HTML structure and 
allows manipulation of the elements within the page.

2. Global Context:

i)  Window: The window object acts as the global context in the browser environment. All global variables and functions are properties and methods of the window object.
ii) Document: The document object is not the global context. It is a property of the window object and specifically deals with the content of the web page.

3. Methods and Properties:

i)  Window: The window object provides methods and properties related to the browser window itself, such as window.open(), window.close(), window.location
and window.history.
ii) Document: The document object offers methods and properties for accessing and manipulating the content of the web page, such as document.getElementById(), 
document.querySelector(), document.createElement(), and document.body.

4. Content Access and Manipulation:

i)  Window: The window object does not directly provide methods for accessing or manipulating the HTML content of the page. Its primary focus is on the window 
and global context.
ii) Document: The document object is specifically designed for accessing and manipulating the HTML content. It allows you to select elements, modify their attributes 
and update the content dynamically.

5. Event Handling:

i)  Window: The window object can handle events related to the browser window, such as load, resize, scroll, and unload. These events are related to the overall 
window and its lifecycle.
ii) Document: The document object handles events related to the content of the web page, such as click, mouseover, keyup, and DOMContentLoaded. These events are 
specific to the elements within the page.

IV. Conclusion |
================

    In summary, the window and document objects are fundamental components of JavaScript in the browser environment. The window object represents the 
browser window and serves as the global context, providing methods and properties for controlling the window and handling global tasks. 
    The document object, on the other hand, represents the content of the web page and provides methods and properties for accessing and manipulating 
the HTML elements.
    Understanding the differences between these two objects is crucial for effectively using JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web applications. 
By leveraging the unique capabilities of both the window and document objects, developers can build robust and engaging user experiences on the web.
